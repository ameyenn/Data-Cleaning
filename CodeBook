#Data Structure of Files and resulting R structure.

testX and trainY store data on the results of activities. Columns store the data as numeric. 
trainX and trainy store data on who did the activity linked via row numbers in trainX[,1] to row numbers in testX, for example.
subject file for each test and train stores the subject named VolunteerID who did the activity and got the result.

Hence the structure is subject, activity (trainy/trainX), testy/testX

Merging these data structures was sensible and one data set was created.

#Describes the data variables

The first four manin data tables structure is as follows:

testX: (num) v1, v2, v3 .......
testy: (num) v1

trainX: (num) v1, v2, v3
trainy: (num) v1

The structure of the other three data tables as follows:

variablesNames (num) V1
               factor: names of the measurement to large to list.
              
subject (num) V1

actLables (num) V1
                factor: names of the activities: WAK etc
              
 
#Data Transformations

1. Meaningful variable names were applied as shown in the code and readme files.

For example:

testX and trainy had the colnames changed from V1..... to meaningful names drawn from variableNames

2. File creation, subseting and merging

The main subset file XandYSubSet was created by merging X and Y, and each were made from merging.
For example: X was formed from merging subject, testy, TestX.
